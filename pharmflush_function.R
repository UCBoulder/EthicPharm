# PharmFlush mdoel, converted to a function.

# pharmflush_model function:
#   * Description: Predicts the influent concentration and mass load of each of
#                  313 pharmaceuticals provided the PharmUse database, the flow
#                  capacity of each water resource recovery facility (WRRF), and
#                  the sewershed population size.
#   * Input: 
#       * flow_capacity: class = numeric, typical daily flow or design capacity
#                        (whichever is available) for the given WRRF in L/d
#       * population_served: class = numeric, size of the population in the 
#                            sewershed of the given WRRF
#   * Output:
#       * average_profile: class = dataframe, dataframe that includes the
#                          average predicted concentration and mass load for
#                          each drug across the 100 sampled ensembles. The 
#                          average number of prescriptions, mass of the dose,
#                          and standard error of the mass load are also included
#                          for each pharmaceutical.
