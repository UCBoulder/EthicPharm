# Predicting social effects on pharmaceutical wastewater concentrations

## Overview
This project focuses on updating the previously developed PharmFlush model to include social predictors, such as over-the-counter medication use and temporal variation in consumption trends, and better predict pharmaceutical concentrations in wastewater influent. More details are provided in the Introduction.pdf file or [website](https://akhilaannireddy.github.io/Predicting-social-effects-on-pharmaceutical-wastewater-concentrations/).

## Data Files
The data files are too large to upload directly, so access is provided by URL here. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for years 2012-2022 are accessible [here](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files_results.jsp?cboDataYear=All&cboDataTypeY=2%2CHousehold+Event+File&buttonYearandDataType=Search&cboPufNumber=All&SearchTitle=Prescribed+Medicines). The literature search data are uploaded directly as Prisma_search_results.xlsx. The current version of the PharmUse database (to which the new data will be incorporated) is also included as pharmuse.csv. Additional data sources will be included during Milestone 2.

## Additional Notes
The R scripts included in this repository will be converted to Python scripts for the project.
